\begin{cvletter}

How does the world that surrounds us work? How humanity managed to put all the information that we daily use in small chunks of silicon? What else can be done? Nowadays everything has a technological nature, it seems like humanity can’t live without technological innovation and I personally can’t wait to see what we will be able to do in the future. 


\lettersection{About Me}
I am a third-year bachelor student of Computer Science at University of Trento. I always had a passion for technology and computers, which is the reason why I chose a bachelor’s degree in this field. I am writing this statement of purpose in order to be admitted to the master course “Computer Science” at University of Trento to further deepen my knowledge. I would like to pursue a career in ICT, precisely in the field of Security and Privacy.


\lettersection{Why Google?}
After my high school graduation as a surveyor and two years as an employee in various fields, I’ve decided to learn more about what has always been my biggest passion and I’ve decided to attend the computer science bachelor’s course. I was admitted in the summer of 2016, I studied hard to grant myself this opportunity, given my past school education I had many obstacles to overcome. I've found every subject very interesting and every single one of them taught me something valuable and applicable in every day’s life. 


\lettersection{Why Me?}
My keen interest for Computer Science has exponentially increased during the last three years and I am determined to keep up good efforts and hard work on my planned studies and geared up well to pass at the best of my possibilities.
The main reason why I am eager to be admitted to this master course is because it offers a high level of preparation in the ICT field. A fundamental aspect is that it is a master’s degree in English, which is something I consider a pivotal aspect for the future perspective of getting a PhD and to pursue a career as a researcher.
